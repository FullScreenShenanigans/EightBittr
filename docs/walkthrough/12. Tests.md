# Tests

EightBittr projects managed by `shenanigans-manager` come with infrastructure for setting up tests.
The `yarn run test` command starts with a `yarn run test:setup` that creates a `test/` directory.

Each package receives a `test/index.html` file to run tests:

-   Open `test/index.html` in a browser to run tests in that browser
-   `yarn run test` includes a `yarn run test:run` command to run tests in "headless" mode

Tests are written in [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
Their files are written using alongside source files under `src/` and named `*.test.ts?`.

## Defining Tests

Most tests retrieve actors from the game in some way and run assertions on them.
The `groupHolder` property of game instances can be used to retrieve actors and the defined groups of them.
Let's add a test to verify that the game starts with exactly one square.

Create a new `FullScreenSaver.test.ts` file as a sibling to `FullScreenSaver.ts`.
Add a `describe` block with an `it` test:

```ts
import { expect } from "chai";

import { createFullScreenSaver } from "./fakes.test";
import { FullScreenSaver } from "./FullScreenSaver";

describe("FullScreenSaver", () => {
    it("starts with one square", () => {
        // Arrange
        const game = new FullScreenSaver({
            height: 320,
            width: 480,
        });

        // Assert
        expect(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares")).to.have.length(1);
    });
});
```

Then, run `yarn test` in your terminal.
You should see output in the terminal including a test success:

```plaintext
  FullScreenSaver
    ‚úÖ starts with one square
```

Open `test/index.html` in a browser.
You should also see a Mocha UI indicating tests passing there too.

Perfect.
Let's add some more tests!

## Simulating Inputs

Testing the result of user interactions is typically done by simulating `game.inputWriter` events.
Let's add a test that pressing a key down spawns a player:

```ts
it("adds a player when a directional input is pressed", () => {
    // Arrange
    const game = new FullScreenSaver({
        height: 320,
        width: 480,
    });

    // Act
    game.inputWriter.callEvent("onkeydown", "left");

    // Assert
    expect(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Players")).to.have.length(1);
});
```

## Fakes

Most game logic that gets tested involves some actions that happen over time.
We'll need our tests to be able to programmatically "tick" the game clock.
EightBittr projects typically use [Sinon's fake timers](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/fake-timers) to do so.

Create a new `fakes.test.ts` file alongside the other test file.
In this file, we're going to add a `createFullScreenSaver` function to create a new `FullScreenSaver` instance with test-specific `components.frameTicker` settings:

```ts
import { useFakeTimers } from "sinon-timers-repeatable";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "./FullScreenSaver";

export const createFullScreenSaver = () => {
    const clock = useFakeTimers();

    const game = new FullScreenSaver({
        components: {
            frameTicker: {
                timing: {
                    cancelFrame: clock.clearTimeout,
                    getTimestamp: () => clock.now,
                    requestFrame: (callback) =>
                        clock.setTimeout(() => {
                            callback(clock.now);
                        }, 1),
                },
            },
        },
        height: 320,
        width: 480,
    });

    game.frameTicker.play();

    return { clock, game };
};
```

You can replace existing `const game` with calls to the `createFullScreenSaver` function:

```ts
const { game } = createFullScreenSaver();
```

Now that our games under test use mocked timing, we can tick forward the clock manually in tests.
We can tick the clock forward by a number of frames by using `game.frameTicker.getInterval()` to get how many clock ticks it take to move the game forward one maintenance cycle.

We can also call `game.physics` to move actors around.
This is useful if we want to, say, move the player out of the way of solids to check what happens when they survive for long enough to create a square

Add a test for the case of the player surviving 150 ticks to the `FullScreenSaver.test.ts` file, and one test for the case of the player not surviving:

```ts
it("increases to two squares 150 ticks after a player is added", () => {
    // Arrange
    const { clock, game } = createFullScreenSaver();
    game.inputWriter.callEvent("onkeydown", "left");

    // (move the player out of the way)
    game.physics.shiftActors(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Players"), 9001, 9001);

    // Act
    clock.tick(150 * game.frameTicker.getInterval());

    // Assert
    expect(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares")).to.have.length(2);
});

it("stops adding squares after the player is hit", () => {
    // Arrange
    const { clock, game } = createFullScreenSaver();
    game.inputWriter.callEvent("onkeydown", "left");

    // Act
    clock.tick(300 * game.frameTicker.getInterval());

    // Assert
    expect(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Players")).to.have.length(0);
    expect(game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares")).to.have.length(1);
});
```

At this point, the game is not only pretty complete for a demo, it's also stable and well-tested.
Awesome stuff!
Give yourself a pat on the back.
