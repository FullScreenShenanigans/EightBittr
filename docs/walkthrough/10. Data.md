# Data

Players are going to want to keep track of how long they were able to survive.
Let's give them points on an interval while they aren't removed from the game.

## Temporary Data

Create a new standalone `Scoring` section at `src/sections/Scoring.ts`.
Give it a `start` member that sets up an interval to increment score as long as a provided player isn't removed:

```ts
import { Actor, Section } from "eightbittr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Keeps track of points and high scores.
 */
export class Scoring extends Section<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Starts regularly increasing score for a player's run.
     */
    public start(player: Actor) {
        this.game.itemsHolder.setItem("score", 0);

        this.game.timeHandler.addEventInterval(
            () => {
                if (player.removed) {
                    return true;
                }

                this.game.itemsHolder.increase("score", 1);
                return false;
            },
            50,
            Infinity
        );
    }
}
```

That will set a _temporary_ storage item under `"score"` for a player's current score.

Add the `Scoring` section as a member to `FullScreenSaver`:

```ts
/**
 * Keeps track of points and high scores.
 */
@member(Scoring)
public readonly scoring: Scoring;
```

Then, call it when creating a new player in `src/sections/Players.ts`'s `requestPlayer`:

```ts
this.game.squares.startAddingSquares(newPlayer);
this.game.scoring.start(newPlayer);
```

Now, after a player is created, you'll be able to check their latest score for the game in your browser console:

```ts
FSS.itemsHolder.getItem("score");
```

## Persistent Data

Let's also add a _permanent_ storage item under `"highScore"` for the highest score they ever achieve.

Add this to the `start` function in `Scoring` inside the `if (player.removed)` body:

```ts
const score = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("score");
const highScore = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("highScore");

if (!highScore || score > highScore) {
    this.game.itemsHolder.setItem("highScore", score);
    this.game.itemsHolder.saveItem("highScore");
}

return true;
```

Now, after a player dies, you'll be able to check the best high score for the game in your browser console:

```ts
FSS.itemsHolder.getItem("highScore");
```

Now that we have both the `"highScore"` and `"score"` data working, redeclare an `itemsHolder` property on the `FullScreenSaver` class with an explicit type parameter:

```ts
/**
 * Cache-based wrapper around localStorage.
 */
public readonly itemsHolder: ItemsHoldr<{
    highScore: number;
    score: number;
}>;
```

Great.
Those browser console look ups aren't good enough for our game though.
Next up, we'll create a text visualization of current points and high scores.
