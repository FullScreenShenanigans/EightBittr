# Text Displays

EightBittr can draw text onto a canvas using the `MenuGraphr` component.
It takes a few steps to set up:

1. Creating text Actor definitions
2. Defining "menus" to place text within
3. Updating those menus during gameplay

Once those are all set up, we'll be able to tell the game to place text there on demand.

## Text Actor Definitions

`MenuGraphr` works by manipulating in-game Actors under a `Text` group.
Each menu will be on top of a hidden menu Actor.
Go ahead and add that group to `src/sections/Groups.ts` last so text gets drawn on top of everything else:

```ts
public readonly groupNames = ["Players", "Squares", "Text"];
```

Add the `Text` name to the `groupHolder` property redeclared on the `FullScreenSaver` class:

```ts
/**
 * General storage abstraction for keyed containers of items.
 */
public readonly groupHolder: GroupHoldr<{
    Squares: Actor;
    Players: Actor;
    Text: Actor;
}>;
```

Additionally, add a corresponding `Text` definition as a child of `Actor` in the `src/sections/Objects.ts` `inheritance`, along with character names such as `CharA` and `Menu` under it:

```ts
public readonly inheritance: ClassInheritance = {
    Actor: {
        Player: {},
        Square: {},
        Text: {
            Char0: {},
            Char1: {},
            Char2: {},
            Char3: {},
            Char4: {},
            Char5: {},
            Char6: {},
            Char7: {},
            Char8: {},
            Char9: {},
            CharA: {},
            CharB: {},
            CharC: {},
            CharD: {},
            CharE: {},
            CharF: {},
            CharG: {},
            CharH: {},
            CharI: {},
            CharJ: {},
            CharK: {},
            CharL: {},
            CharM: {},
            CharN: {},
            CharO: {},
            CharP: {},
            CharQ: {},
            CharR: {},
            CharS: {},
            CharT: {},
            CharU: {},
            CharV: {},
            CharW: {},
            CharX: {},
            CharY: {},
            CharZ: {},
            Menu: {},
        },
    },
};
```

...as well as basic Actor definitions in that file's `properties`:

```ts
Menu: {
    hidden: true,
},
```

```ts
Text: {
    groupType: "Text",
    height: 8,
    scale: 2,
    width: 8,
},
```

Note that the `scale` for text Actors is `2`, to make their sprites twice as big as the stored graphical data.

Finally, add sprite definitions in `src/sections/Graphics.ts` for each of the text characters:

```ts
public readonly library = {
    CharA: "x011,1x06,101x05,101000010001000x15,001x05,101x05,10",
    CharB: "x08,x15,0001000010010000100x16,001x05,101x05,10x16,00",
    CharC: "x010,111100010000101x07,1x07,1x08,100001000111100",
    CharD: "x08,x15,000100001001x05,101x05,101x05,1010000100x15,000",
    CharE: "x08,x17,01x07,1x07,x16,001x07,1x07,x17,0",

    CharO: "x010,111000010001001x05,101x05,101x05,100100010000111000",
    CharP: "x08,x16,001x05,101x05,10x16,001x07,1x07,1",

    CharU: "x08,1x05,101x05,101x05,101x05,101x05,100100001000x15,0",
    CharV: "x08,1x05,101x05,10010001000100010000101x05,101x06,10000",
    CharW: "x08,1x05,1010010010101010101010101011000110110001101x05,10",
    CharX: "x08,110001100100010000101x06,1x06,1010000100010011000110",
    CharY: "x08,1x05,100100010000101x06,1x07,1x07,1x07,10000",
    CharZ: "x08,x17,x06,1x06,1x06,1x06,1x06,1x06,x17,0",
    Char0: "x018,1110000100110011000110110001100110010000111000",
    Char1: "x018,11x05,111x06,11x06,11x06,110000x16,00",
    Char2: "x017,x15,001100011x05,111001111000111x05,x17,0",
    Char3: "x017,x16,x05,110000111x08,110110001100x15,00",

    Char6: "x017,x15,0011x06,x16,0011000110110001100x15,00",
    Char7: "x016,x17,01100011x05,11x05,11x05,11x06,110000",
    Char8: "x017,x15,00110001100x15,0011000110110001100x15,00",
    Char9: "x017,x15,0011000110110001100x16,x06,1100x15,00",
    Player: "x21024,",
    Square: "x14096,",
};
```

Now, if you add a text Actor in your browser console, it should show up on the screen:

```ts
FSS.actors.add("Char7");
```

## Defining Menus

`MenuGraphr` isn't one of the core modules configured with `EightBittr`.
You'll need to install it as a dependency and regenerate `lib/index.html` to be able to import it:

```ts
yarn add menugraphr
yarn run hydrate
```

Modules are constructed using creator methods that take in the game instance and return the new instance of the module.

To access it as a member of the game, define its a new creator in `src/creators/createMenuGrapher.ts`:

```ts
import { MenuGraphr } from "menugraphr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

export const createMenuGrapher = (game: FullScreenSaver): MenuGraphr =>
    new MenuGraphr({
        game,
        schemas: {
            Score: {
                height: 48,
                position: {
                    vertical: "bottom",
                },
                textPaddingX: 8,
                textPaddingY: 24,
                width: game.mapScreener.width / 2,
            },
        },
    });
```

Add it as a factory component in the beginning of the `FullScreenSaver` class:

```ts
/**
 * Text-based menu and dialog management system.
 */
@factory(createMenuGrapher)
public readonly menuGrapher: MenuGraphr;
```

Now, you can create a menu and add text to it in your browser console:

```ts
FSS.menuGrapher.createMenu("Score");
FSS.menuGrapher.addMenuDialog("Score", "HI");
```

## Updating Menus

First, let's add a menu to visualize score while a player is alive.
Add a `refreshDisplay` member to `Scoring` to handle a new score displayed on the screen:

```ts
/**
 * Creates a Score menu to handle score and high score.
 */
public refreshDisplay() {
    const score = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("score");
    const highScore = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("highScore") || 0;
    this.game.menuGrapher.createMenu("Score");
    this.game.menuGrapher.addMenuDialog("Score", `SCORE ${score}\nHIGHSCORE ${highScore}`);
}
```

Call that member in `start` whenever the score changes:

```ts
public start(player: Actor) {
    this.game.itemsHolder.setItem("score", 0);
    this.refreshDisplay();

    this.game.timeHandler.addEventInterval(
        () => {
            if (player.removed) {
                const score = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("score");
                const highScore = this.game.itemsHolder.getItem("highScore");

                if (!highScore || score > highScore) {
                    this.game.itemsHolder.setItem("highScore", score);
                    this.game.itemsHolder.saveItem("highScore");
                }

                this.refreshDisplay();
                return true;
            }

            this.game.itemsHolder.increase("score", 1);
            this.refreshDisplay();
            return false;
        },
        50,
        Infinity,
    );
}
```

Glorious: text appears as soon as the player is created, and updates for their new scores.

The game seems pretty complete for a demo at this point.
The last step for us to take will be to add tests.
Fun!
