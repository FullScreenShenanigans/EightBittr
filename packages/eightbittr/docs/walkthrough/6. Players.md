# Players

Let's add a way to create a player in the game who can move around the screen when given input by the player.
We'll create that player when the left key is pressed for the first time.

## Actor Definition

Creating the player Actor definition follows similar steps to the squares:

1. Create a new object declaration in `Objects`:

    ```ts
    public readonly inheritance: ClassInheritance = {
        Actor: {
            Player: {},
            Square: {},
        },
    };
    ```

    ```ts
    public readonly properties: ClassProperties = {
        Player: {
            height: 32,
            groupType: "Players",
            width: 32,
        }
    ```

2. Create a group for the players in `Groups`:

    ```ts
    public readonly groupNames = ["Players", "Squares"];
    ```

3. Define a new color (light green) and sprite data (a square) for the new type in `Graphics`:

    ```ts
    public readonly library = {
        Player: "x21024,",
        Square: "x14096,",
    };
    ```

    ```ts
    public readonly paletteDefault: Palette = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [255, 255, 255, 255],
        [35, 255, 70, 255],
    ];
    ```

## Player Creation

Instead of the console log in your `left` handler in `Inputs`, add a call to a new `Players` section's `requestPlayer` method:

```ts
left: (event) => {
    event?.preventDefault();
    this.game.players.requestPlayer();
},
```

This new `Players` section will be the first _standalone_ section you'll create.
It will be its own class extending from `Section`, instead of a similarly named core section.
That means it won't have to declare a `Game` generic:

```ts
import { Section } from "eightbittr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Creates and updates player Actors.
 */
export class Players extends Section<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Creates a new Player, if there wasn't one already.
     */
    public requestPlayer() {
        const existingPlayer = this.game.groupHolder.getActor("player1");
        if (existingPlayer) {
            return;
        }

        const square = this.game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares")[0];
        const newPlayer = this.game.actors.add([
            "Player",
            {
                id: "player1",
                xvel: -5,
                yvel: 0,
            },
        ]);

        this.game.physics.setMidYObj(newPlayer, square);
        this.game.physics.setRight(newPlayer, square.left - newPlayer.xvel);
    }
}
```

That `id: "player1"` will allow the new player Actor to be retrieved by id later on.
The above code creates a player Actor on top of the first square Actor in the game with that id and some horizontal velocity.

Lastly, add an entry to the `Maintenance` section for players to be maintained as well:

```ts
    public readonly maintainers: [string, ActorMaintainer][] = [
        ["Squares", this.maintain],
        ["Players", this.maintain],
    ];
```

Now, when you hit the left arrow key, up to one green square will appear on the screen and bounce around horizontally.

Next up, we'll let the user control player movements.
