# Instantiation

For the sake of this game, let's say we want to immediately create a square at the center of the screen.
We'll add logic to the `constructor` in the `FullScreenSaver` class that does so using:

-   `this.things.add` to create a new Square
-   `this.mapScreener` to retrieve the (x,y) center of the screen
-   `this.physics.setMid` to place the Square aligned on that (x,y) center

```ts
public constructor(settings: IEightBittrConstructorSettings) {
    super(settings);

    this.quadsKeeper.resetQuadrants();

    const square = this.things.add("Square");
    const midX = this.mapScreener.width / 2;
    const midY = this.mapScreener.height / 2;

    this.physics.setMid(square, this.mapScreener.height / 2, this.mapScreener.width / 2);
}
```

Now, upon refreshing the screen, there should be a horizontally and vertically centered white square in the center of the screen.
Very artistic.

Next up, we'll get that square bouncing around the screen.
