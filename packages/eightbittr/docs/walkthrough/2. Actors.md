# Actors

In-game objects are known as "Actors" (alternately referred to as "Entities" in other game engines).
We'll need to set up a few components to define:

1. `Objects`: Object inheritance map and default properties.
2. `Groups`: Storage of groups of Actors.
3. `Graphics`: Visual sprites for Actors.

## Objects

This will be the first component we'll create as part of this guide.
As with many sections you'll end up creating, there already exists a core section by the same name provided by `EightBittr`.
Yours will inherit from that core `Objects` class and extend it with your own game's object data.
Create a new `Objects` class at `src/sections/Objects.ts` defining a root `Actor` object and a `Square` extending from it:

```ts
import { Objects as EightBittrObjects } from "eightbittr";
import { ClassInheritance, ClassProperties } from "objectmakr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Raw ObjectMakr factory settings.
 */
export class Objects extends EightBittrObjects<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * A tree representing class inheritances, where keys are class names.
     */
    public readonly inheritance: ClassInheritance = {
        Actor: {
            Square: {},
        },
    };

    /**
     * Member name for a function on Actor instances to be called upon creation.
     */
    public readonly onMake = "onMake";

    /**
     * Properties for each class.
     */
    public readonly properties: ClassProperties = {
        Square: {
            height: 64,
            groupType: "Squares",
            width: 64,
        },
        Actor: {
            onMake: this.game.actors.process.bind(this.game.actors),
        },
    };
}
```

Then import that class in `src/FullScreenSaver.ts` and declare it as a `@member` of `FullScreenSaver`:

```ts
import { member } from "babyioc";
import { EightBittr, EightBittrConstructorSettings } from "eightbittr";

import { Objects } from "./sections/Objects";

/**
 * My new fancy game.
 */
export class FullScreenSaver extends EightBittr {
    /**
     * Raw ObjectMakr factory settings.
     */
    @member(Objects)
    public readonly objects: Objects<this>;

    /**
     * Initializes a new instance of the FullScreenSaver class.
     *
     * @param settings   Settings to be used for initialization.
     */
    public constructor(settings: EightBittrConstructorSettings) {
        super(settings);

        this.quadsKeeper.resetQuadrants();
    }
}
```

Your game can now theoretically _create_ `Square` Actors, but it'll need to be informed of how to handle them at runtime.

## Groups

Create another new game section, `Groups`, at `src/sections/Groups.ts` to define a single group named `Squares`:

```ts
import { Groups as EightBittrGroups } from "eightbittr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Collection settings for Actor group names.
 */
export class Groups extends EightBittrGroups<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Names of known Actor groups, in drawing order.
     */
    public readonly groupNames = ["Squares"];
}
```

Add this new section as a member to your `FullScreenSaver` class too:

```ts
/**
 * Collection settings for Actor group names.
 */
@member(Groups)
public readonly groups: Groups<this>;
```

Now that the `Square` _exists_, we'll want to give it some sprite info to be _rendered_.

## Graphics

Create a new `Graphics` section in `src/sections/Graphics.ts` with sprite palette colors, default scaling settings, and screen drawing settings.

```ts
import { Graphics as EightBittrGraphics } from "eightbittr";
import { Palette } from "pixelrendr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Stores the visual appearance of Actors.
 */
export class Graphics extends EightBittrGraphics<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Initial background to set.
     */
    public readonly background = "black";

    /**
     * Nested library of Actor sprites.
     */
    public readonly library = {
        Square: "x14096,",
    };

    /**
     * The default palette of colors to use for sprites.
     */
    public readonly paletteDefault: Palette = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [255, 255, 255, 255],
    ];
}
```

Add the new `Graphics` section to your `FullScreenSaver` class as well.

Now the game can create a new `Square` without crashing.
Hooray!

To test it out, in your browser developer tools console, test it out by accessing the `FSS` global member:

```ts
FSS.actors.add("Square");
```

The new square should show up as a 64x64 white box in the top-left corner of the screen.

That command should have printed a few properties a new Actor to the console.
You can also find that new Actor in the game's `GroupHoldr`:

```ts
FSS.groupHolder.groups.Solid[0];
```

Next up, we'll want to place that square in the center of the screen.
