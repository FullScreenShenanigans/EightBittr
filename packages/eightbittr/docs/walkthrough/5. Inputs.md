# Inputs

We're going to add console logging whenever the user presses the _left_ key.

Create an inherited `Inputs` section in `src/sections/Inputs` with `aliases` to bind arrow keys to their named equivalents, a `triggers` map pointing from those aliases to functions, and global initialization to call those pipes on the global keydown event:

```ts
import { IGameWindow, Inputs as EightBittrInputs } from "eightbittr";
import { ITriggerContainer } from "inputwritr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * User input filtering and handling.
 */
export class Inputs<TEightBittr extends FullScreenSaver> extends EightBittrInputs<TEightBittr> {
    /**
     * Known, allowed aliases for input event triggers.
     */
    public readonly aliases = {
        left: [37],
    };

    /**
     * Mapping of events to their key codes, to their callbacks.
     */
    public readonly triggers: ITriggerContainer = {
        onkeydown: {
            left: (event) => {
                event?.preventDefault();
                console.log("Left!");
            },
        },
    };

    /**
     * Adds InputWritr pipes as global event listeners.
     */
    public initializeGlobalPipes(gameWindow: IGameWindow) {
        super.initializeGlobalPipes(gameWindow);

        gameWindow.addEventListener(
            "keydown",
            this.game.inputWriter.makePipe("onkeydown", "keyCode")
        );
    }
}
```

You'll want to add an `inputs` member to the `FullScreenSaver` class as well.

At this point, the game should be logging `"Left!"` whenever the left key is initially pressed down.
Next, we'll hook that input detection up to a player to allow them to move.
