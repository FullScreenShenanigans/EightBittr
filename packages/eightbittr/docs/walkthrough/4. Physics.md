# Physics

Moving the square around the screen will involve shifting it by its velocity every game tick.

That involves:

-   Giving the square some initial velocity in the constructor
-   Declaring a "maintenance" function to run on squares each game tick
-   Bouncing the square off the screen walls when it hits them

## Initial Velocity

Change the constructor statement creating the `square` variable to give it velocity properties:

```ts
const square = this.actors.add([
    "Square",
    {
        xvel: 2,
        yvel: -2,
    },
]);
```

## Moving By Velocity

Create a new `Maintenance` class in `src/sections/Maintenance.ts` containing a `maintain` function that moves an actor by its velocity each tick and a `maintainers` array with an entry for `"Squares"` and that function:

```ts
import { Maintenance as EightBittrMaintenance, Actor, ActorMaintainer } from "eightbittr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Update logic for Actors in game ticks.
 */
export class Maintenance extends EightBittrMaintenance<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Maintains a general Actor for a tick.
     */
    public readonly maintain = (actor: Actor) => {
        this.game.physics.shiftBoth(actor, actor.xvel, actor.yvel);
    };

    public readonly maintainers: [string, ActorMaintainer][] = [["Squares", this.maintain]];
}
```

Now, when you refresh the game, the starting square should slowly fly up and to the right.

## Wall Bouncing

We can check on each square's maintenance tick whether it's passed any of the screen walls and reverse its velocity if so.
Add the following code to the `maintain` function to do so:

```ts
if (actor.top < 0) {
    actor.yvel *= -1;
    this.game.physics.setTop(actor, -actor.top);
}

if (actor.bottom > this.game.mapScreener.height) {
    actor.yvel *= -1;
    this.game.physics.shiftVert(actor, this.game.mapScreener.height - actor.bottom);
}

if (actor.left < 0) {
    actor.xvel *= -1;
    this.game.physics.setLeft(actor, -actor.left);
}

if (actor.right > this.game.mapScreener.width) {
    actor.xvel *= -1;
    this.game.physics.shiftHoriz(actor, this.game.mapScreener.width - actor.right);
}
```

At last, we've achieved the promise of the game: a moving white square that bounces off the sides of the screen.

Next, let's add an interactive "player" component for players to move around.
