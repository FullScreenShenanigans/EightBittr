# Collisions

Our collision detection logic will have _player_ Things check for touching any _square_ Things and kill off the player if so.

That will involve three areas of work:

1. _Selection_: Having Things know which Things they share quadrants with.
2. _Detection_: Determining whether a collision is happening.
3. _Handling_: Reacting to a collision taking place.

## Quadrant Selection

Create a new `Quadrants` section declaring `"Players"` and `"Squares"` as active groups to have quadrants determined:

```ts
/**
 * Arranges game physics quadrants.
 */
export class Quadrants<TEightBittr extends FullScreenSaver> extends EightBittrQuadrants<
    TEightBittr
> {
    /**
     * Groups that should have their quadrants updated.
     */
    public readonly activeGroupNames: string[] = ["Players", "Squares"];
}
```

Player and square Things will now know their game quadrants, but not how to check for collisions with each other.

## Collision Detection

Create a new `src/sections/Collisions.ts` with an inheriting `Collisions` section.
Its first member should be a `collidingGroupNames` array that just includes `"Players"`, to indicate they should check for collisions against other Things:

```ts
import { Collisions as EightBittrCollisions, IThing } from "eightbittr";

import { FullScreenSaver } from "../FullScreenSaver";

/**
 * Checkers and callbacks for Thing collisions.
 */
export class Collisions<TEightBittr extends FullScreenSaver> extends EightBittrCollisions<
    TEightBittr
> {
    /**
     * Names of groups that should be checked for collisions.
     */
    public readonly collidingGroupNames: string[] = ["Players"];
}
```

Next, create a `hitCheckGenerators` object containing a function to check whether a player touches a solid:

```ts
/**
 * Function generators for checking whether two Things are colliding.
 */
public readonly hitCheckGenerators = {
    Players: {
        Solids: () =>
            (player: IThing, solid: IThing) =>
                player.right >= solid.left
                && player.left <= solid.right
                && player.bottom >= solid.top
                && player.top <= solid.bottom
    }
}
```

The game will now know when a player is touching a solid, but it won't know what to do about it.

## Collision Handling

Add an equivalent `hitCallbackGenerators` later in the class to kill the player:

```ts
/**
 * Function generators for reacting to two Things colliding.
 */
public readonly hitCallbackGenerators = {
    Players: {
        Solids: (player: IThing) => this.game.death.kill(player)
    },
};
```

Now, whenever a player touches a square, it'll be "killed" and removed from its group.

Next up, let's staying a live a little more difficult over time.
