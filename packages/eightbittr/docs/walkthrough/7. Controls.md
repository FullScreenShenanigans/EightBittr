# Controls

Now that we can create a player in the game, let's hook up inputs to changing the player's direction.

This will involve three parts:

1. Creating a `Direction` enum to represent one of the four directions
2. Creating `Inputs` logic for all four directions
3. Signaling to `Players` which direction is created

## `Direction` enum

Create a new file at `src/Direction.ts` and export a `Direction` enum from it with four members:

```ts
export enum Direction {
    Top = 0,
    Right = 1,
    Bottom = 2,
    Left = 3,
}
```

We'll use this `Direction` enum elsewhere in code to signal which direction an input is facing.

## Directional `Inputs`

Back in the `Inputs` section, add `aliases` for the remaining three arrow keys:

```ts
public readonly aliases = {
    bottom: [40],
    left: [37],
    right: [39],
    top: [38],
};
```

...and corresponding `triggers` for each of them that also pass their respective `Direction` value to `requestPlayer`:

```ts
public readonly triggers: ITriggerContainer = {
    onkeydown: {
        bottom: (event) => {
            event?.preventDefault();
            this.game.players.requestPlayer(Direction.Bottom);
        },
        left: (event) => {
            event?.preventDefault();
            this.game.players.requestPlayer(Direction.Left);
        },
        right: (event) => {
            event?.preventDefault();
            this.game.players.requestPlayer(Direction.Right);
        },
        top: (event) => {
            event?.preventDefault();
            this.game.players.requestPlayer(Direction.Top);
        },
    },
};
```

You'll need to `import { Direction } from './Direction';` at the top of the file.

TypeScript should also now be complaining that `requestPlayer` doesn't take in a direction argument.
Let's fix that.

## Directional `Players`

We'll need to define the the horizontal and vertical speed for each potential direction.
Do so with a standalone object in the `src/sections/Players.ts` file:

```ts
/**
 * Raw speed player velocities will be based off of.
 */
const speed = 5;

/**
 * Horizontal and vertical player speeds for each possible direction.
 */
const directionVelocities = {
    [Direction.Top]: {
        xvel: 0,
        yvel: -speed,
    },
    [Direction.Right]: {
        xvel: speed,
        yvel: 0,
    },
    [Direction.Bottom]: {
        xvel: 0,
        yvel: speed,
    },
    [Direction.Left]: {
        xvel: -speed,
        yvel: 0,
    },
};
```

Next, add a `direction` parameter of type `Direction` to `requestPlayer`:

```ts
/**
 * Creates a new player, if there wasn't one already.
 */
public requestPlayer(direction: Direction) {
```

# Player Movements

You can now set the player's velocity on that direction whenever the key is pressed -- both for an _existing_ player:

```ts
const existingPlayer = this.game.groupHolder.getThing("player1");
const velocities = directionVelocities[direction];

if (existingPlayer) {
    Object.assign(existingPlayer, velocities);
    return;
}
```

...and for a _new_ player:

```ts
const newPlayer = this.game.things.add([
    "Player",
    {
        id: "player1",
        ...directionVelocities[direction],
    },
]);

this.game.physics.setMidObj(newPlayer, square);
this.game.physics.shiftBoth(
    newPlayer,
    (newPlayer.xvel * square.width + 1) / speed,
    (newPlayer.yvel * square.width + 1) / speed
);
```

Amazing: we can now control the player with key movements.

Next, let's add collision detection for the players against squares to give those movements a purpose.
