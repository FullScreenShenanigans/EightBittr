# Events

This game gets pretty boring with only one square bouncing around the screen.
Let's have the game square spawn another square every once in a while to spice actors up a little.

We'll do this by adding a function called whenever a square is added to the game that schedules a new square to be added after a set number of game ticks.

## Squares Setup

Create a new standalone `Squares` section at `src/sections/Squares.ts` with an `addSquare` member function that takes in a coordinates and velocity to create a new square:

```ts
/**
 * Creates square Actors in the game.
 */
export class Squares extends Section<FullScreenSaver> {
    /**
     * Creates a new square in the game.
     */
    public addSquare(midX: number, midY: number, xvel: number, yvel: number) {
        const square = this.game.actors.add(["Square", { xvel, yvel }]);

        this.game.physics.setMid(square, midX, midY);
    }
}
```

After adding this section to the `FullScreenSaver` class:

```ts
/**
 * Creates square Actors in the game.
 */
@member(Squares)
public readonly squares: Squares;
```

Also modify `FullScreenSaver`'s constructor to use this method to create its initial square:

```ts
public constructor(settings: EightBittrConstructorSettings) {
    super(settings);

    this.quadsKeeper.resetQuadrants();

    this.squares.addSquare(
        "Square",
        this.mapScreener.width / 2,
        this.mapScreener.height / 2,
        2,
        -2,
    );
}
```

## Square Spawns

We'll want to only spawn squares if there aren't too many of them already on the screen.
Add this somewhat arbitrary value (it starts at about 8 on tiny screens and ranges up to around 16 on normal laptop screens) to the `Squares` class:

```ts
/**
 * Maximum number of squares to stop spawning after.
 */
private readonly maximumSquares = Math.sqrt(this.game.mapScreener.height * this.game.mapScreener.width / 2000) | 0;
```

Create a member variable function in the `Squares` class named `startAddingSquares` that takes in a square and sets a `TimeHandlr` timeout to create a new square with opposite, slightly smaller velocity _if_ the player is still alive _and_ there aren't too many existing squares:

```ts
/**
 * Starts spawning new squares while it still can.
 */
public readonly startAddingSquares = (player: Actor) => {
    this.game.timeHandler.addEventInterval(
        () => {
            if (player.removed) {
                return true;
            }

            const solids = [...this.game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares")];

            for (const square of solids) {
                if (solids.length >= this.maximumSquares) {
                    return true;
                }

                this.addSquare(
                    this.game.physics.getMidX(square),
                    this.game.physics.getMidY(square),
                    -square.xvel * 0.75,
                    -square.yvel * 0.75,
                );
            }

            return false;
        },
        150,
        Infinity,
    );
};
```

That function sets an interval to duplicate squares frequently.
It'll stop itself when the player no longer exists or there are too many squares.

Call it when a new player is added at the bottom of `requestPlayer` in `src/sections/Players.ts`:

```ts
this.game.squares.startAddingSquares(newPlayer);
```

## Square Cleanups

Lastly, let's have all squares but the first be deleted whenever the player dies.
That'll roughly reset the game back to its normal state.

Back in `src/sections/Collisions.ts`, add a few lines to the function created within `hitCallbackGenerators` to kill all squares but the first:

```ts
public readonly hitCallbackGenerators = {
    Players: {
        Squares: () => (player: Actor) => {
            this.game.death.kill(player);

            for (const square of this.game.groupHolder.getGroup("Squares").slice(1)) {
                this.game.death.kill(square);
            }
        },
    },
};
```

The game is getting harder now!
Next up, we'll give the player points for lasting without getting killed.
