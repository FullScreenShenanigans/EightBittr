# Walkthrough

This page will guide you through the steps to create a new game using the EightBittr game engine.
The game will feature a player avoiding boxes bouncing around a screen like an old screensaver and include a basic suite of tests.

> Make sure you've read through the other documentation pages listed in the [EightBittr README.md](../../README.md) before reading this one!

## Preface

This guide has a lot of copy & paste for a lot of repetitive steps!
EightBittr is still undergoing active pre-1.0 development.
These steps will become simpler over time...
