# PixelRendr.js

A moderately unusual graphics module designed to compress images as
compressed text blobs and store the text blobs in a StringFilr. These tasks are
performed and cached quickly enough for use in real-time environments, such as
real-time video games.

## Summary

At its core, PixelRendr.js is a library. It takes in sprites and string keys to
store them under, and offers a fast lookup API. The internal folder structure 
storing images is at its core a tree, where strings are nodes similar to CSS 
classNames. See StringFilr for more information on storage, and ChangeLinr
for the processing framework.

#### Generating Sprites

The most straightforward way is to use the encodeUri API. Rendering is done by 
loading an image onto an HTML <img> element, so a browser is required; any image
 format supported by that browser may be provided.

```javascript
MyPixelRender.encodeURI("http://my.image.url.gif", function (results) {
    console.log(results);
});
```

#### Sprites Format

To start, each PixelRendr keeps a global "palette" as an Array[]:
    
```javascript
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0],         // transparent
    [255, 255, 255, 255], // white
    [0, 0, 0, 255],       // black
    // ... and so on
]
```

Ignoring compression, sprites are stored as a Number[]. For example:

```javascript
"00000001112"
```
    
Using the above palette, this represents transparent pixels, three white pixels,
 and a black pixel. Most images are much larger and more complex than this, so a
 couple of compression techniques are applied:

1. **Palette Mapping**

    It is necessary to have a consistent number of digits in images, as 010 
    could be [0, 1, 0], [0, 10], or etc. So, for palettes with more than ten 
    colors, [1, 14, 1] would use ["01", "14", "01"]:

    ```javascript
    "011401011401011401011401011401011401011401"
    ```

    We can avoid this wasted character space by instructing a sprite to only use
    a subset of the pre-defined palette:

    ```javascript
    "p[1,14]010010010010010010010"
    ```

    The 'p[0,14]' tells the renderer that this sprite only uses colors 0 and 14,
    so the number 0 should refer to palette number 1, and the number 1 should
    refer to palette number 14.

2. **Character Repetition**

    Take the following wasteful sprite:

    ```javascript
    "p[0]0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    ```

    We know the 0 should be printed 35 times, so the following notation is used
    to indicate "Print ('x') 0 35 times (','))":

    ```javascript
    "p[0]x035,"
    ```

3. **Filters**

    Many sprites are different versions of other sprites, often simply identical
    or miscolored (the only two commands supported so far). So, a library may 
    declare the following filter:

    ```javascript
    "Sample": [ "palette", { "00": "03" } ]
    ```

    ...along with a couple of sprites:

    ```javascript
    "foo": "p[0,7,14]000111222000111222000111222",
    "bar": [ "filter", ["foo"], "Sample"]
    ```

    The "bar" sprite will be a filtered version of foo, using the Sample filter.
    The Sample filter instructs the sprite to replace all instances of "00" with
    "03", so "bar" will be equivalent to:
 
   ```javascript
   "bar": "p[3,7,14]000111222000111222000111222"
   ```
 
    Another instruction you may use is "same", which is equivalent to directly
    copying a sprite with no changes:

    ```javascript
    "baz": [ "same", ["bar"] ]
    ```

4. **"Multiple" sprites**

    Sprites are oftentimes of variable height. Pipes in Mario, for example, have
    a top opening and a shaft of potentially infinite height. Rather than use 
    two objects to represent the two parts, sprites may be directed to have one
    sub-sprite for the top/bottom or left/right, with a single sub-sprite 
    filling in the middle. Pipes, then, would use a top and middle.

    ```javascript
    [ "multiple", "vertical", {
        "top": "{upper image data}",
        "bottom": "{repeated image data}"
    } ]
    ```

## Sample Usage

1. Creating and using a PixelRendr to create a simple black square.

    ```javascript
    var PixelRender = new PixelRendr({
            "paletteDefault": [
                [0, 0, 0, 255] // black
            ],
            "library": {
                "BlackSquare": "x064,"
            }
        }),
        sizing = {
            "spriteWidth": 8,
            "spriteHeight": 8
        },
        sprite = PixelRender.decode("BlackSquare", sizing),
        canvas = document.createElement("canvas"),
        context = canvas.getContext("2d"),
        imageData;

    canvas.width = sizing.spriteWidth;
    canvas.height = sizing.spriteHeight;

    imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    PixelRender.memcpyU8(sprite, imageData.data);
    context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
    ```
    
2. Creating and using a PixelRendr to create a simple white square, using the
   simple black square as reference for a filter.
   
   ```javascript
   var PixelRender = new PixelRendr({
            "paletteDefault": [
                [0, 0, 0, 255],      // black
                [255, 255, 255, 255] // white
            ],
            "library": {
                "BlackSquare": "x064,",
                "WhiteSquare": ["filter", ["BlackSquare"], "Invert"]
            },
            "filters": {
                "Invert": ["palette", {
                    "0": 1,
                    "1": 0
                }]
            }
        }),
        sizing = {
            "spriteWidth": 8,
            "spriteHeight": 8
        },
        sprite = PixelRender.decode("WhiteSquare", sizing),
        canvas = document.createElement("canvas"),
        context = canvas.getContext("2d"),
        imageData;

    canvas.width = sizing.spriteWidth;
    canvas.height = sizing.spriteHeight;

    imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    PixelRender.memcpyU8(sprite, imageData.data);
    context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
    ```
