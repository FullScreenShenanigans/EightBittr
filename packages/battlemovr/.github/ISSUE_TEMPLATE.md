    ### Bug Summary

    The player can still walk after a battle cutscene has started.

    ### Steps to Reproduce

    1. Start a game with Pokemon in the player's party
    2. Trigger a battle with `FSP.battles.startBattle` (see docs/battles.md)
    3. Immediately try to walk - you can, but shouldn't be able to.

    ### Feature Request

    Can we get a mod that lets the player push people out of the way automtically?

    When you're fast-forwarding through the game, it's annoying having to try to move around NPCs.
    I'd like it if we the player walking into them would push them out of the way without changing the player's velocity.

    Bonus points if they get a little "!" on top of their head. That'd be cute.
