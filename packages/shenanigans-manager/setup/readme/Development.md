### Running Tests

```shell
yarn run test
```

Tests are written in [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
Their files are written using alongside source files under `src/` and named `*.test.ts?`.
Whenever you add, remove, or rename a `*.test.t*` file under `src/`, `watch` will re-run `yarn run test:setup` to regenerate the list of static test files in `test/index.html`.
You can open that file in a browser to debug through the tests, or run `yarn test:run` to run them in headless Chrome.
