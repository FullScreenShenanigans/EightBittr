[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FullScreenShenanigans/ScenePlayr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FullScreenShenanigans/ScenePlayr)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sceneplayr.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sceneplayr)

A stateful cutscene runner for jumping between scenes and their routines.



## Build Process

ScenePlayr uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automate building, which requires [Node.js](http://node.js.org).

To build from scratch, install NodeJS and run the following commands:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```

See [Build Details](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/Documentation/blob/master/Build%20Details.md) for detailed Gulp usage.
