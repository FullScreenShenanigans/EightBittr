# ScenePlayr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FullScreenShenanigans/ScenePlayr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FullScreenShenanigans/ScenePlayr)

A cutscene runner for jumping between scenes and their routines.


## Build Process

ScenePlayr uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate building, which 
requires [Node.js](http://node.js.org). The process is straightforward; see 
[Grunt's help page](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for more info.

To build from scratch, install NodeJS, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
grunt
```

The output will now be in the /dist folder. Source codes will be in /dist/src,
and a zipped version will be in /dist.
