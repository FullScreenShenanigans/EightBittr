Bare-bones, highly modular game engine for 2D 8-bit games.
<!-- /Top -->

EightBittr is an in-progress experimental game engine targeted to 8-bit retro 2D games. 
It's got some great features built-in, such as:

* ‚ö° **Blazing-fast** start times: averaging sub-second on a 3G connection & old laptop _including_ HTML parse and load
    * Lazily-instantiated and -loaded components
    * Lazily-instantiated actor classes with inline POJO sprite declarations
    * ~200KB minified / ~50KB gzipped
* üîß **Easy scaffolding** for extensible mods, level editors, and random map generation
* üñê **Full touch UI** support with [UserWrappr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/UserWrappr) and [TouchPassr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/TouchPassr) 

:x: :warning: _EightBittr isn't production ready or well-supported - you're better off using a more standard game engine._ :warning: :x:

### Documentation

More docs are comming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è!

In the meantime, check the list of dependencies under `package.json` and read their `README.md`s.

<!-- Development -->
## Development

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/):

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/EightBittr
cd EightBittr
npm install
npm run setup
npm run verify
```

* `npm run setup` creates a few auto-generated setup files locally.
* `npm run verify` builds, lints, and runs tests.

### Building

```shell
npm run watch
```

Source files are written under `src/` in TypeScript and compile in-place to JavaScript files.
`npm run watch` will directly run the TypeScript compiler on source files in watch mode.
Use it in the background while developing to keep the compiled files up-to-date.

#### Running Tests

```shell
npm run test
```

Tests are written in [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
Their files are written using  alongside source files under `src/` and named `*.test.ts?`.
Whenever you add, remove, or rename a `*.test.t*` file under `src/`, `watch` will re-run `npm run test:setup` to regenerate the list of static test files in `test/index.html`.
You can open that file in a browser to debug through the tests.
